# mtgsets
[mtgsets](https://www.mtgsets.com): An attempt to re-create this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Magic:_The_Gathering_sets#Expansion_sets) page to some degree.  Specifically the tables as for some reason the set icons get removed every once in awhile.

### Developing
```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Goals
Play with existing Magic: The Gathering community projects: [MTGJSON](https://mtgjson.com/) and [Keyrune](https://keyrune.andrewgioia.com/index.html).  
Learn cards and sets that were released while I was not playing magic.  
Experiment with [vite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite).  
Quick view to single card prices and card image within a set.  
Project is frontend only.
